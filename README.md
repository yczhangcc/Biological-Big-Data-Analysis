### 📄 **README: RNA-seq Data Analysis Workflow for Data Science and Data Engineering** 🔬

#### 🔍 **Overview**
This project focuses on implementing an RNA-seq data analysis workflow 🧬 from a data science and data engineering perspective. The workflow covers essential stages such as data preprocessing, quality control, alignment, quantification, and data interpretation. This README is designed to guide data scientists and data engineers in understanding how the workflow is set up, automated, and optimized for efficiency and scalability.

#### 🚀 **Workflow Stages**

1. **🔧 Data Preprocessing and Quality Control**
   - **Data Input**: Raw sequencing data in the form of FASTQ files (R1 and R2 paired-end reads) 📂.
   - **Quality Control**: Assess the quality of sequencing reads using FastQC and MultiQC 🛠. These tools provide reports on adapter contamination and low-quality bases 📉.
   - **Data Trimming**: Use Trimmomatic ✂️ to trim low-quality regions and adapter sequences.

2. **📍 Data Alignment**
   - **Alignment Tools**: BWA 🧩 and Bowtie2 🏹 are used for aligning the cleaned sequencing reads to the reference genome 🧬. These alignments are stored in SAM/BAM formats 🗂.
   - **Data Engineering Focus**: The data is structured and indexed to enable efficient querying and analysis 🔄.

3. **📊 Quantification and Data Transformation**
   - **Quantification**: Tools like Salmon 🐟 and RSEM 🧮 estimate gene or transcript expression levels.
   - **Data Engineering Focus**: This step transforms raw sequencing data into structured datasets 📊, ready for further machine learning and statistical analysis 🤖.

4. **📈 Data Interpretation and Statistical Analysis**
   - **Differential Expression Analysis**: Analyze gene expression data to identify which genes are differentially expressed 💡.
   - **Machine Learning Integration**: Extend the workflow with machine learning models for clustering 🧠 or predicting biological outcomes based on expression profiles 🔮.

#### 🛠 **Tools and Technologies**
This workflow uses industry-standard tools:

- **🧪 FastQC & MultiQC**: For quality control checks.
- **✂️ Trimmomatic**: For trimming adapters and low-quality bases.
- **🧬 BWA & Bowtie2**: For sequence alignment.
- **🗂 Samtools**: For processing SAM/BAM files.
- **🐟 Salmon & RSEM**: For quantification.

These tools ensure that raw data is transformed into structured, analyzable data 📊, allowing for predictive modeling and biological interpretation 🌱.

#### 🛠 **Usage Instructions**

1. **Run Quality Control** 🔍:
   Start by assessing the quality of raw reads using FastQC and compile the results using MultiQC.
   ```bash
   fastqc -o qc_results data/*.fastq
   multiqc qc_results
   ```

2. **Trim Adapters and Low-Quality Bases** ✂️:
   Use Trimmomatic to clean up the raw sequencing data.
   ```bash
   trimmomatic PE input_R1.fastq input_R2.fastq trimmed_R1.fastq trimmed_R2.fastq
   ```

3. **Align Reads** 🧬:
   Align the cleaned reads to the reference genome using Bowtie2 or BWA.
   ```bash
   bowtie2 -x reference_index -1 trimmed_R1.fastq -2 trimmed_R2.fastq -S output.sam
   ```

4. **Quantify Gene Expression** 📊:
   After alignment, quantify transcript abundance using Salmon or RSEM.
   ```bash
   salmon quant -i index_dir -l A -1 trimmed_R1.fastq -2 trimmed_R2.fastq -o quantification/
   ```
